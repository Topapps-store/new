### Hello

> Hello i was a user of this app and I wanted to address a problem with the app, this could be my phones problem or the app but I won’t assume anything, so I couple of days ago I was just on my phone as usual and then I get so many notifications about my water tracker(bc I have it set up like that) but usually I would get the notifications like once an hour, this time they kept going on and on to the point where it made my phone crashed and after my phone restarted they kept coming back, so I made the choice to delete the app and I did that. A couple days later the app appears on my phone, but I never got it back, this time it had no icon and it just said “WomenLose” and I felt uncomfortable so I deleted it again, the next day it appeared on my phone again BUT I NEVER GOT IT BACK,AND IT SAID THE SAME THING!!!
>
> “WomenLose” WITH NO ICON, again.
>
> than today(or at least the time I’m typing this) IT APPEARS AGAIN, SAME NAME,SAME NO ICON, EVERYTHING
>
> Would I recommend this app to anyone yes but the fact that this happened I dont think I will now, I’m sorry but this is a problem and like I said in the begging it may be the app or my phone but other than that I feel like you should check your app just in case

### Great with some flaws

> I love the app personally, easy to follow animations of how to do the workouts that don’t take long to do at all, and nice options for extra workouts not in your plan based on the different body section to want to work on. But it does have a few downsides, bit drastic with the amount of ads, though it doesn’t bother me all that much, but the main thing is the step counter. I’m not sure if it’s a premium option or not, since it shows it and lets you choose the average you want every day but it never seems to work. I always have it set but every time I check it it says zero which makes no sense. I’d say I walk a lot every day, I definitely take more steps than zero for sure. I’ve tied walking with the app open, phone off and on, with the app closed and nothing ever works. So if I could get some direction on it or something that’d be nice.

### Developer Response ,

> Thank you for your feedback. We understand how frustrating frequent ads can be. We're working on improving the user experience. In the meantime, you might consider our ad- removal service for an uninterrupted experience. As for the step counter issue, please first check if the permission to access steps from Apple Health is turned on. Click Settings on your iPhone->Health->Data Access & Devices-> Lose Weight for Men at Home->Turn On All. Then restart our app, see if the steps are updated later. Feel free to contact us if you need further assistance!
