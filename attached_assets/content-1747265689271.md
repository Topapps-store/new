Before the most recent update everything was ACTUALLY working great. I wasn't having any issues at all. Since the most recent update back to the same old problems with the app not working correctly, glitching, batches keep coming/going/coming again, etc. Not sure what happened, but please go back to the previous updates. Everything was so much better.

We want to help you with the issue you’re having. Please contact us via DM (@instacarthelp - X), via DM (Instagram) or private message (Facebook) so we can look into what’s happening.

App often crashes while shopping and features like being able to add an item or substitute an item that you just arranged with your customer may not work in the app. App may be unable to recognize the substitution or disallow it and there is no good way to add it or force it. Support has very limited ability to help. If you are buying an aluminum baking pan, beware. The app will require you to scan your customer's license as if it were a med or alcohol. This is very irritating to our customers.

Thanks for letting us know. Your feedback helps us continue to improve your experience with Instacart. Please update your app for the latest features.

Had been on the waitlist for over a year & was never contacted about any open spots. That was fine, but then someone I know in the same area instantly got in as a full service shopper as I was still on the waitlist waiting for an "opening". Contacted customer service and they told me they would forward the issue to a higher up manager last year, was never contacted since. Just deleted and retried to sign up and was waitlisted again. Instacart needs to review their waitlist & ghosted accounts.
