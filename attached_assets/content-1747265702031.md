excellent app to find assistance with any projects needed. one annoying feature is that you have to enter what you are looking for twice, once when you are requesting your job and then again after you select what team you would like to go with. also, at the start of the process you get to pick your crew but later when it asks if you want to send the quote to other people, it doesn't let you pick from the first group of options and gives you only 1-2 additional teams, no way to search others

Thank you for your feedback, Albert. We’re glad to hear you’ve found Thumbtack helpful for your projects. We also appreciate you pointing out the areas where we can improve. It’s great to know what you liked, and we’ll consider your suggestions as we continue to improve the user experience.

Generally pleased with our first experience with the app. Only complaint was that it suggested a couple of businesses that were states away. Not sure how this happened but good communication with the businesses that reached out to us ensured that we understood where each was physically located. Everyone was very kind and pleasant and understood when we couldn't work with them. Good messaging within app.

We love hearing success stories like yours! Our goal is to make finding the right pros easy and efficient. Thanks for choosing Thumbtack!

The new "AI" is horrible. I was trying to find mobile car detailing, and while the follow up prompts were relevant, the final suggestion was for house cleaning or junk removal. I tried 5 times with different variations, but always got house cleaning or junk removal, never car detailing. I also could not find a way to use the "old search" without going through the AI prompts.
