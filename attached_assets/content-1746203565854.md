one of the worst app experiences I have had -- beware! drivers are barely vetted, and do shady things like Mark you as bring in the car when you haven't boarded. And "help" is barely there; you have option to click on chat bot responses but no way to reach a human if facing a serious safety issue (like not being picked up or if you are being scammed by a driver). low trust app. 2 stars because the design look is good and can fool the average user. but terrible customer experience.

This app is incompatible with GrapheneOS location services: You can book a taxi, but you must manually enter the city location. The map does seem to accurately display your GPS position/orientation, but the search has incorrect locations. Google Maps has no problem on this device. Please add proper support for GrapheneOS. Thank you!

Riders are usually okay but food service is below average as I find hard time doing simple things that are available on other apps such as communicate with the restaurants my orders are with. Also difficult to search for specific types of food. Although this is generally available, restaurants that don't fit specific descriptions (vegan, vegetarian, Indian) end up in the results anyway. This app is allowing restaurants to list themselves on lists that fit every description for more traffic.

Some say bugs are the future of food: They are rich in protein and can be sustainably produced for mass consumption. In fact, some 2 billion humans on the planet eat bugs as part of their diet. But when the bug is in an app, we won't want you to eat it. And we certainly won't try to make more of it.

Update your Grab to 5.355.0 to get rid of bugs from your everyday app experience.
