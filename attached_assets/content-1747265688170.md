NOT recommended. Upon downloading thÃ­s app, I was awarded $15.00 or $20.00 off my first TWO orders. This worked fine for the first order, but would not work for the second, at the time I attempted to use it. Now, the offer is gone completely. Worse, there is apparently no way to contact anyone regarding this specific issue. Extremely frustrating! ðŸ˜¡

Unfairness to customers. I work hard for my money. And to be waiting almost 1 hour and the time keep change. This is not far to either. And I'm always ordering. I see I have to stop using this app again. I'm losing $17 dollars for an order that is late on the app and restaurant behalf. Also, they only do $5 credit, and they would charge you for canceling the order they are taking long on and this the second time in two dayz.

I used to love this app, but it's gone way downhill. The chat is useless so you have to google the customer service number to get any real help. The bundle order option is non-existent. They used to credit $5 if your order was extremely late, but quietly took that away. The app constantly crashes. Some greedy CEO is probably taking all the profit leaving nothing for drivers. I'm definitely not renewing my membership, which they make impossible to cancel. Use doordash or GrubHub instead.
