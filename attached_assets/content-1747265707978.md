"The app is not great. Seeing a professional is good, & not too challenging to set-up, but the app has a LOT of quirks." -- This is the start of a previous review I left and the app tech responded as seen below, sharing an email address that I should contact. I did, and it was sent back as undeliverable. So, sadly no actual help. The service with medical professionals good. The app has issues & no support.

We never intend to disappoint our members and apologize for the inconvenience. If you need further assistance, please contact us at information@teladochealth.com and provide your name, preferred phone, and screenshot of this review so we can contact you directly. Thank you for your feedback.

I'm glad I have the service, but the app is shockingly terrible, on a level that's pretty unacceptable for a medical platform. random notifications about appointments that don't exist, random notifications that an appointment has ended when it ended months ago, just so many errors. It feels like a beta-testing environment.

If you have any more information to help our dev team make improvements, please send us an email at information@teladochealth.com with your name, phone number, and screenshot of this review along with more details. We will prioritize this ASAP.

Had teledoc before but now I have different insurance so new account. I was finally able to login to the website and start interacting, then everything went wrong. Nothing loaded, error after error...I decided to try the app, so I just installed it and it appears that it's actually worse! Not sure what happened in the interim between the last time I had teledoc and now but something went terribly wrong. Update 1/12/25 Seems fixed now.
