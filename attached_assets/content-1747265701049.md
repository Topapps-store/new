Used to love Splitwise when it was free. You now have to pay to get the "Pro" edition and be able to put in unlimited payments. It is SO inconvenient when on a trip (3 payments a day - really???). You saw green, and because of corporate greed, you ruined what was once an amazing app to use with friends when in vacation. To heck with you. I'm moving to Splid.

Was a pretty great app for tracking. Emphasis on WAS. Now you can only add a handful of expenses before they lock you out and require their "Pro" subscription. They also make you wait a 10 second timer before adding each expense unless you have "Pro". This isn't how it was before, so it's pretty scummy business practices to change it to be predatory like this, after all this time using it. Time to look for alternative apps.

This is suvh a good app that helps groups split bill while lessening friction and promoting transparency. I really love it but now i see the feature to settle individual items is no longer available on the free version. you can only settle by typing the amount paid without being able to show which items you're settling, which is terrible.
