## App Description

Windows 11 is the latest version of the Microsoft operating system, launched in October 2021. It was developed as a functional and aesthetic improvement to Windows 10. Windows 11 adds and improves various features from Windows 10 while also removing some. The operating system now boasts a modern design with softer color palettes and rounded edges.

In terms of functionality, it includes many exciting features, such as the ability to run Android apps natively. Additionally, Windows 11 can accommodate [Microsoft’s Office suite](https://microsoft-office.en.softonic.com/) applications, such as [Microsoft Word](https://microsoft-word.en.softonic.com/), [Microsoft Excel](https://microsoft-excel.en.softonic.com/) and [Microsoft PowerPoint](https://microsoft-powerpoint.en.softonic.com/). For security, there's Sandbox, and the new Windows comes with updated sounds that are modern, less intrusive, and more pleasant.

## **Windows 11 new design**

As mentioned, Windows 11 was initially developed as a functional and aesthetic improvement to Windows 10. Much effort went into redesigning the interface rather than building entirely new features, resulting in a brand-new look, which Microsoft dubbed Fluent Design. The new operating system features rounded edges and softer color palettes, giving it a smoother, more consistent look. Other design updates include:

- **Copilot:** Copilot is Microsoft's AI tool in Windows 11. You can give it commands by typing in a chat box, clicking a microphone icon, and speaking. It understands what to do when told in a natural language and supports plug-ins.
- **Start menu and Taskbar:** The Start button is now center-aligned on Windows 11, marking one of the more significant adjustments in the new OS. The Start menu has also been completely revamped, featuring pinned apps at the top of the panel and recommended apps below. A new "All apps" button is located at the top right of the Start menu to view all apps.
- **File Explorer:** File Explorer gets a new look, including colorful folder icons on the left panel and a less busy Ribbon at the top. It now features tabs, allowing you to open several pages in one window, and the system can now handle RAR and 7-Zip files without third-party software.
- **Windows Search:** The search function has evolved from just a button to a more interactive feature that shows results from various sources like your documents, photos, folders, and the web. The search function also toggles a panel where you can access Copilot and recently used apps.
- **Widgets:** Windows 11 has a widget panel showing news, weather, sports scores, and more. You can add Windows tiles or third-party widgets to this section.
- **Notifications and Quick Settings:** The notifications area now features a clean, single panel with a circled number that indicates the total number of notifications. The Quick Settings panel is now separate from the notification panel, accessed by clicking the connection, speaker, or battery icon. It is customizable, allowing you to add more features, and it retains the hover function over the three mentioned icons to see their status.
- **Snap Layouts and multitasking:** The Snap Layout function lets you arrange app windows on the screen, and you can access it by hovering over the maximize button. Snap Layouts are accessible through the Taskbar, and you can choose whether to open a single or a group of apps. This feature is also available on tablets.
- **Redesigned settings:** Windows 11 addresses most of the inconsistencies in settings and dialogs in Windows 10. The overall design is much improved, but some controls still use the old style. Switch between Light and Dark mode in color settings, and Dark mode looks much better, especially with its effective use of transparency. Further, Windows 11 now uses a modern, less intrusive default set of system sounds that improve the user experience.

## **An updated Task Manager**

Task Manager has been redesigned with a new look. It lets you stop unresponsive programs and monitor those consuming many system resources such as CPU, disk space, and bandwidth. The new Task Manager includes an efficiency mode that lets you reduce the resource usage of specific applications, reducing their impact on the overall system performance.

## **Snipping Tool**

The old Snip & Sketch has been replaced by the Snipping Tool. This tool has been revamped with new features, including a delay timer for screenshots, the ability to take still images and screen recordings, and the ability to capture and redact sensitive information from screenshots using AI. You can also use third-party apps for these functions, but the Snipping Tool has become more convenient and better in Windows 11.

## **App Store is not just an app store**

The Microsoft Store has gotten a stylish revamp in Windows 11, and it doesn't only feature apps; it also offers games, movies, and TV shows. An even more significant change for developers is that they no longer need to use UWP app type to be included in the Store; large programs like Visual Studio and Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) can also be added. There are also new features for PWAs, including Meta Quest VR support and custom title bars. The Store also lets users play casual games directly and features an AI hub.

## **Teams integration**

Teams was a big part of Windows 11 during the launch, and now Teams Chat and Teams Meetings have been combined into one efficient app. In Windows 11, Teams comes as part of Windows 11, offering free calls and texts to any mobile device from a PC.

## **Gaming gets better**

PC gamers will love the new Windows 11 features that improve game selection and performance. The Xbox app, integrated into Windows 11, gives access to Xbox Cloud gaming and Xbox Game Pass collection, effectively turning PCs into gaming consoles. The gaming experience has also improved thanks to technologies like Auto HDR for better color clarity and DirectStorage for faster load times. Additionally, Windows 11 gets Dynamic Refresh for battery saving and support for the fast Wi-Fi 6E standard.

## **A more secure and faster Windows**

Thanks to TPM and Secure Boot, Windows 11 is now more protected against unauthorized access and malware. Microsoft Defender has also been improved. Performance-wise, Windows 11 performs better than Windows 10, especially in gaming and productivity, and in case of any sluggish performance, you get a myriad of ways to boost performance.

## **Accessibility got better**

Accessibility has been enhanced in Windows 11, building on features like Windows Speech Recognition, Narrator, Magnifier, and Closed Captions. You can also add third-party assistive devices. New features include new themes on assistive features, AI-powered voice typing, live captions transcribed from audio sources, and improved braille display support. Copilot has also been enhanced to include assistive features.

## **System requirements:**

You can download Windows 11 for free, but you will need at least 64 GB of available storage to run Windows 11, a 2-core processor, and at least 4 GB RAM for optimal operation. Only 64-bit versions are available, but it supports 32-bit apps.
