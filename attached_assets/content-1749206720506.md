### The app works fine but the prices and services went down

> My car was in service for one week. In this time my intention was to use uber. Morning, day, evening, night, high demands which means that the prices were high because of this. If you manage to get a good price, the ride will be canceled or nobody will pick you up. When you try again the price is very high and suddenly you can get picked up. More than this, the drivers has some cheap taxi drivers habits and during the summer most of them will not use the air conditioner. They will just leave down the windows in front. Why the hell should we use uber in this case? Is the same thing as a taxy, but more expensive.

### Ubber help costs money on drivers/app fault?!

> I ordered an Uber from my home and it said it will arrive in ~10 minutes. As I live at a house, usually I wait outside, on the street, I don't mind as the weather is nice. As I am waiting, 5 minutes pass and the app doesn't show where the driver is on he's way to pick me up but instead it shows the trip started?! I write to the driver and asked if he arrived or what's going on and he says the app bugged itself and to tell him the street again from where he's supposed to pick me up. I wait for another 10 minutes and by this time the driver stopped responding and the app refreshed itself. All followed by an email that thanked me for the ride with Andrei, a ride from point A to point B, not even the same ride I ordered, I think it was the driver's previous order. Money taken on what? 20 minutes late now, ordered another Uber. I contacted Uber help from the app, explained what happened and money got returned back in an hour tops. Interesting thing now, my bank account says Uber support billed me 5ron for a mistake I did not make. I had to break my head into the complicated and almost hidden way to contact you guys and for your mistake I get billed for a service that SHOULD be free of charge. Shame on you!

### If you care about your time, don't use Uber

> Uber drivers do not take customers' time seriously. I have had the experience many times of ordering a ride, only to be told that it will arrive in 3 minutes and in fact it arrived in 10. Other times I received a message from the driver who was supposed to be on his way to me that he took another ride (in fact not mentioned to me by the application) and it takes another 15 minutes until it comes to me. I believe that everyone's time is important and what is happening is disrespectful. Another time I was waiting for a 10-minute race. The driver had changed the route he was supposed to take 3 times, and when I called him he told me that the car was broken and he was looking for a car service. He told me to wait for him until he comes. I missed a train because of that driver.
>
> More disturbing than that is that when you meet such drivers and cancel the ride because you cannot afford to wait 20 minutes, you are charged extra. It's disrespectful on the part of the application to make it the driver's fault and I have to pay for it
